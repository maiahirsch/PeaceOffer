## 💡 Concept and Inspiration
Growing up in Venezuela, I witnessed protests where individuals offered white flowers to the Guardia Nacional (military) as a symbol of peace and hope. These gestures were often rejected, reflecting a stark reality: peace requires mutual effort. This dress transforms that poignant symbol into an interactive statement, inviting viewers to reflect on the importance of reciprocity in achieving harmony.

## 🎨 Features and Design
- **Interactive Blooming Mechanism:** Flowers on the dress bloom when touched, lowering a barries between two peoples.
- **Delicate Aesthetic:** Petals crafted from organza evoke a light, ethereal quality.
- **Seamless Integration of Technology and Art:** Using high-torque motors and custom-designed supports, the dress brings organic movement to life while maintaining its elegance.
